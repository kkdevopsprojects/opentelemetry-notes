# Kubectl Installation on Ubuntu EC2 

## Objective

Install the official `kubectl` binary on an Ubuntu EC2 instance to manage Kubernetes clusters via command-line.

---

## Step 1: Download the Latest Stable Version of Kubectl

Use the following command to download the latest `kubectl` binary:

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

This will download the binary for the currently stable Kubernetes version directly from the official Kubernetes release channel.

---

## Step 2: Install the Binary to System Path

Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/` and set correct permissions:

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

This makes `kubectl` available system-wide.

---

## Step 3: Verify the Installation

To confirm that `kubectl` is installed and working:

```bash
kubectl version --client
```

You should see the client version details (e.g., `Client Version: v1.30.0`).

## Additional Notes

* This installation method works on any Debian-based system like Ubuntu.
* If you're installing on **other Linux distributions**, **macOS**, or **Windows**, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for platform-specific steps:
