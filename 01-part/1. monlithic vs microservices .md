# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## üß± MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE

### üîπ Definition

A monolithic application is built as a **single, unified unit**. All components (UI, business logic, data access) are **tightly coupled** and run in one process.

### üîß Structure

```

+---------------------------+
\|  User Interface (UI)     |
+---------------------------+
\|  Business Logic           |
+---------------------------+
\|  Data Access Layer (DAL)  |
+---------------------------+
\|  Database                 |
+---------------------------+
\|  Deployed as One WAR/JAR  |
+---------------------------+

```

### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Simple Development  
* Easy Testing  
* High Performance (no network latency between components)  
* Easy to Deploy (single unit)

### ‚ùå Disadvantages

* Hard to Scale  
* Tightly Coupled  
* Slow Build/Deploy cycles  
* Limited Tech Stack  
* Difficult Maintenance and CI/CD

## üß© MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### üîπ Definition

An application is broken down into **independent services**, each responsible for a **specific business functionality** and can be developed, deployed, and scaled **independently**.

### üîß Structure

```

Cart Service     Product Service     Payment Service
\|                  |                   |
Cart DB          Product DB          Payment DB

```

‚Üí Communication: REST/gRPC/Kafka  
‚Üí Deployed as Docker containers / K8s pods

### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Independent Scaling  
* Language Agnostic  
* Faster CI/CD Pipelines  
* High Resilience  
* Small, Independent Teams

### ‚ùå Disadvantages

* Operational Complexity  
* Network Overhead  
* Distributed Debugging  
* Data Consistency Challenges

## üÜö Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature           | Monolith                   | Microservices                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Deployment**    | Single unit (WAR/JAR)      | Multiple services (Docker/K8s)    |
| **Tech Stack**    | One stack                  | Polyglot (Go, Python, Java, etc.) |
| **Scalability**   | Full app only              | Per-service scaling               |
| **Release Cycle** | Slower                     | Faster                            |
| **Testing**       | Easier Integration Testing | Requires Mocks & Contracts        |
| **Data Store**    | Shared DB                  | DB per service                    |
| **Communication** | In-process                 | REST/gRPC/Kafka                   |
