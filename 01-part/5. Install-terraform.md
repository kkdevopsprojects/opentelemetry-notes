# Terraform Installation on Ubuntu EC2 

## Objective

Install the latest stable version of **Terraform** on an Ubuntu EC2 instance using the official HashiCorp APT repository.

---

## Step 1: Install Required Packages

Ensure the system is up to date and install required tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
```

These tools are needed to manage repositories and GPG keys securely.

---

## Step 2: Add the Official HashiCorp GPG Key

Download and add HashiCorp's official key:

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
```

This ensures that packages you install are signed and verified.

---

## Step 3: Add the HashiCorp APT Repository

Add the stable HashiCorp repository to your system:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
```

This makes Terraform and other HashiCorp tools available via apt.

---

## Step 4: Update APT Cache

Refresh package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

## Step 5: Install Terraform

Install Terraform from the added repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get install terraform -y
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Installation

Check if Terraform is installed and working:

```bash
terraform -help
```

You should see Terraform's CLI help output.
